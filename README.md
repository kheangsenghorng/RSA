# RSA Encryption Project

This repository contains a simple implementation of the RSA encryption algorithm. RSA is a public-key cryptosystem widely used for secure data transmission.

## Features

- Generate RSA public and private keys
- Encrypt messages using the public key
- Decrypt messages using the private key
- Easy to understand and extend

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kheangsenghorng/RSA.git
cd RSA
```
